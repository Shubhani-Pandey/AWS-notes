------BOOTSTRAPING-----
Deploy your application by launching your instance
Providing the script in user data and launching application during instance


META DATA----> all the data about CE2 instance present in the details tab


We can associate the Elastic Ip address with the puvlib Ip address so thta it doesn't change
1. Go to elastic Ip in left panel and create the Elastic Ip
2. Go to actions and click on associate elastic Ip and chose that instance.
( during this step it asks for pvt Ip because the public IP is linked with pvt IP)


--------EC2 STORAGE TYPES-------
1. File STORAGE[ Elastic File Store EFS]


2. Block STORAGE[ Elastic Block Store EBS]--> 
data persists independently of the life of instance.
File systems and databases can be run
EBS volume of one AZ can only be used with EC2 instance of that AZ
One EBS can be moutned with one instance only(for multiple mouting use EFS)
Whenver we create any EBS valome , AWS creates its replica in same AZ as a backup



-----------------EBS VOLUME TYPES-----------
General Purpose SSD(GP2)
1. Cheap
2. Balance of price and performance
3. 3 * IOPS/GB upto 10,000 IOPS 
    eg--> 50GiB will have 3*50=150 IOPS  but min=100 IOPS hence even when 8GiB we get 100 IOPS    ***********************************
4. Burst upto 3000 IOPS for volumes
5. Bootable

IOPS = INPUT OUTPUT OPERATION PER SEC


Provisioned IOPS SSD(IO1)
1. I/O intensive application eg RDBMS or noSQL
2. >10,000 IOPS and can provision upto 20,000 IOPS/volume
3. Bootable

Throughput Optimized HDD(ST1): Magnetic Disks
1.Frequently accessed, Sequential data 
2. Big Data, Data Warehouse, Log Processing etc
3. Can't be the BOOT vol


Cold HDD(SC1)
1. Lowest cost for non-frequent accessed workloads
2. File Server
3. Can't be the BOOT vol


Magnetic(Standard)
1. Bootable and used for non-frequently accessed data.



-------IMPORTANT-----
Since only General Purpose, Provisional and Magnetic are Bootable...therefore only these three options are available for ROOT while creating the instance...while all 5 instances are available in case of EBS.


3. Object STORAGE[ Simple Storage Service S3, Glacier]


------AMAZON INSTANCE STORE (Root Volume when EBS only ot selected)-----
data stored on local instance store persists only as long as instance is alive.
storage is ephemeral(lasts for a very short time)



---------------SNAPSHOTS----------
Backup of EBS volumes
Snapshots are stored on S3
Snapshots are point in time copies of volumes
These are incremental backups. Only changed blocks are moved to S3.
First snapshot takes time.
Excludes data in the cache of OS and application
Status of EBS snapshots can be monitored using CloudWatch events.



--------------CREATE AMI--------------

AMI is like the snapshot of the root volume
Snapshot just contains data while AMI contains OS, application etc

1. Provides info required to launch instance, which is a virtual server in cloud.
2. AMI includes following
--Template for root vol of instance(OS, applications, application server etc)
--Launch permissions that control which AWS account can use AMI to launch instance
--Block device mapping that specifies the vol to attach to instance when it's launched.
3.Select AMI based on following
--Region
--OS
--Launch Permissions
--Architecture(32/64 bit)
--Storage for root
