----EC2-----
Scalable computing
eliminates hardware investment
launch virtual server, configure security and networking, maanage storage
reducing need to forecast traffic, since scalable
pay for what you use
linux or windows
for reliability--> chose across regions and availability zones

------LAUNCHING EC2 INSTANCE FROM AMI-----
AMI(Amazon Machine Image)---> template that contains software config(os,server, applications)
from AMI we can launch 1 or multiple instances, which are copy of AMI running as virtual server in cloud.
Instances keep running until we stop or terminate them or they fail. We can launch new instance from AMI.


------AMI BY-----
my AMI
AMI marketplace
Community AMI
Free tier



------IMPORTANT-------
public Ip address and public DNS address are not available when the instance is in stop state, while pvt DNS and pvt IP address are available. 
To get the public DNS and public IP we should start the instance first.


-----EC2 FAMILY TYPES------
Dense Storage(Fileservers/Data Warehousing/ Hadoop)--->D2
Compute optimized(CPU Intesnsive)---->C4
Memory optimized(Memory intensive Apps/Dbs)--> R4
Memory optimized(SAP HANA/ Apache Spark)----> X1
Graphic Intensive(Video Encoding/ 3d Application Streaming)---->G2
High speed storage(NoSQL, Data Warehousing)--->t2
Lowest cost, General Purpose(web servers/ small db)---->T2
General Purpose(Application servers)-----> M4
Field Programmable Gate Array(Hardware Acceleration)--->F1
Graphics/ General Purpose(ML , Bitcoin mining)---> P2




------EC2 PRICING OPTIONS-------
ON DEMAND--> fixed rate by hour, for low costa nd flexibity without upfront payment, short-term and unpredictable workspace.
RESERVED---> for 1-3 yrs,steady usage, capacity reservation based on baselining and hence signicantly less hourly charge
SPOT--->Bid for instance, application with flexible start and end times,lowest cost and no cost for hour when AWS terminates instance.
DEDICATED HOSTS--> physical EC2 dedicated servers. Useful in case of server bound licenses for regulatory requirements. On demand pricing and cheap if reserved.


-----FEATURES OF EC2-----
1. vurtual computing env, known as instances
2. preconfigured templates, known as AMI's(OS and additional softwares)
3. various configs of CPU, storage, memory known as INSTANCE TYPES------
4. secure login info using key pairs (AWS stores public key, we need to store private key)
5. Storage vol for temp data that is del when instance terminates, INSTANCE STORE VOLUMES
6. persistant storage volumes for data using (Amazon EBS), Amazon EBS VOLUME
 
 
 
--------EC2 lifecycle------IMPORTANT------
1. Payment only during RUNNING AND STOP-HIBERNATING status and never anywhere else.
2. Stop-Hibernating is between running and stopping, where the system saves the files in background.


------EC2 INSTANCE ACCESS------
PUBLIC DNS
PUBLIC IP---> this chnages everytime we start and stop a instance, thus ervytime we will need to connect again because of diff IP
ELASTIC IP ( OR STATIC PUBLIC IP)---> this keeps the IP fixed, thus paid
