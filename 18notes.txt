AWS GLOBAL INFRA
Region-> location -> have multiple availbaility zones -> thus region= collection of availability zones
Availability zone-> physical loc of data center with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region
AWS Local Zones-->extension of an AWS Region, it places compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users. With AWS Local Zones, you can easily run highly-demanding applications that require single-digit millisecond latencies to your end-users
AWS Wavelength--> it brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G network, minimizing the latency to connect to an application from a mobile device.
                  deliver single-digit millisecond latencies to mobile devices
				  eg-> game and live video streaming, machine learning inference at the edge, and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR)
AWS Outposts--> bring native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility.


Edge location-> used during transfer of data from one AZ to another.

applications to run in multiple AZ's to achieve even greater fault-tolerance.

example--> Mumbai Region has 3 availability zones(data centers)


IMP
25 regions with 80 availability zones across world

ADVANTAGES
Security
Flexibility
Easy to Use
Scalability (vertical scalability(increase RAM) or horizontal scalability(Use one more Server))
Cost Savings



--------AWS SERVICES----------
(COMPUTE TAB) EC2(IAAS) -> SERVER
EBS(elastic box service-> STORAGE-> like hard disk-> can be connected to EC2 insatnce)
EFS(Elastic file sharing)-> STORAGE-> Shared by differnet ec2 instances
S3(Simple Storage Service)-> Storage
RDS-> Relational database service-
(Networking) VPS-> Virtual Private Cloud -> for placing servers-> outside VPC no one will have access to that server
Route 53
Load Balancer
(COMPUTE TAB) AutoScaling -> for increasing capacity
CloudWatch -> watch all other cloud services-> for monitoring
CloudTrail -> maintains logs-> which servie used by whom and how-> that log can then be stored in a storgae sevice like S3, EBS etc
(COMPUTE TAB)Elastic Beanstalk -> PaaS -> dont have to worry about platform fror hosting, takes care of that --> run and manage web apps
(APPLICATION INTEGRATION TAB)SNS (Simple Notification Service) , SQS(Simple Queue Service)-> for sending mail to user-> eg in case of uthauth access atempt
(COMPUTE TAB) LAMBDA(Serverless Service)(IAAS) -> we don't need to worry about background, takes care of it --> servers initiated on backend automatically
Direct connect (costly)(VPN not costly)-> establish connection between aws server(some servers that were migrated to AWS) and local machine(on-premises)
CodeCommit(version control)
Code build(build code)]
code deploy(deploy code)
code pipeline->integrates code commit+build+deploy so contiues addition and continues deployemnt takes place i.e CACD pipeline..like Jenkins
